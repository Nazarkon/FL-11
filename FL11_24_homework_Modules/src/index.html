                <p>Rock, Paper, Scissors is a game for two players typically played using the players' hands. The two
                    players each make a fist with one hand and hold the other open, palm upward. Together, they tap
                    their fists in their open palms once, twice, and on the third time form one of three items: a rock
                    (by keeping the hand in a fist), a sheet of paper (by holding the hand flat, palm down), or a pair
                    of scissors (by extending the first two fingers and holding them apart).
                    The winner of that round depends on the items formed. If the same item is formed, it's a tie. If a
                    rock and scissors are formed, the rock wins, because a rock can smash scissors. If scissors and
                    paper are formed, the scissors win, because scissors can cut paper. If paper and a rock are formed,
                    the paper wins, because a sheet of paper can cover a rock. After one round is completed, another is
                    begun. Play continues until one player reaches a predetermined score, or whenever the players'
                    boredom is alleviated. (Often this game is played to pass the time while waiting in line for
                    something, or while on a long road trip [as long as the driver isn't one of the players].)</p>
